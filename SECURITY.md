# Security Policy - Delete Profile Worker

## Overview

This document outlines the security considerations, best practices, and vulnerability management for the Delete Profile Worker. This worker handles sensitive user profile deletion operations and requires robust security measures.

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Bearer Token Authentication**: All requests must include a valid Bearer token in the Authorization header
- **Token Validation**: Tokens are validated against the backend authentication system
- **User Context Isolation**: Each request is processed within the authenticated user's context only
- **Permission Verification**: User permissions are verified before allowing profile deletion

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Request Validation**: All incoming requests are validated for proper format and required fields
- **Parameter Sanitization**: User input is sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- **Content-Type Enforcement**: Only application/json content type is accepted
- **Method Restriction**: Only DELETE HTTP method is allowed

### Backend Security
- **Secure Communication**: All backend API calls use HTTPS with proper authentication
- **API Authentication**: Backend requests include proper authentication headers
- **Timeout Protection**: Network timeouts prevent hanging connections
- **Error Handling**: Backend errors are handled securely without exposing sensitive information

### Data Protection
- **No Sensitive Logging**: Personal information is never logged or stored in worker logs
- **Error Message Sanitization**: Error responses are sanitized to prevent information leakage
- **Secure Headers**: Security headers are included in all responses
- **CORS Protection**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is properly configured

## Security Configurations

### Environment Variables
```
BACKEND_URL - Backend API endpoint (configured as secret)
```

### Required Security Headers
- Content-Security-Policy
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-Frame-Options
- Referrer-Policy
- Strict-Transport-Security

### CORS Configuration
- Allowed origins must be explicitly configured
- Credentials are not allowed in CORS requests
- Only required HTTP methods are permitted

## Threat Model

### Potential Threats
1. **Unauthorized Profile Deletion**: Malicious actors attempting to delete other users' profiles
2. **Token Hijacking**: Compromised authentication tokens used for unauthorized access
3. **Injection Attacks**: SQL injection, NoSQL injection, or command injection attempts
4. **Information Disclosure**: Sensitive data exposure through error messages or logs
5. **Rate Limiting Bypass**: Attempts to overwhelm the system with excessive requests

### Mitigations
1. **Strong Authentication**: Bearer token validation with backend verification
2. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive sanitization of all user inputs
3. **Error Handling**: Generic error messages without sensitive information
4. **Rate Limiting**: IP-based request throttling (when configured)
5. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging of security events

## Incident Response

### Security Event Monitoring
- Failed authentication attempts
- Invalid request patterns
- Backend integration failures
- Unusual traffic patterns

### Response Procedures
1. **Immediate**: Identify and contain the threat
2. **Analysis**: Determine scope and impact
3. **Mitigation**: Implement fixes and patches
4. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
5. **Documentation**: Record incident details and lessons learned

## Vulnerability Management

### Reporting Security Issues
- **Contact**: Report security vulnerabilities through appropriate channels
- **Response Time**: Security issues will be acknowledged within 24 hours
- **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure process with 90-day timeline

### Security Updates
- Regular security reviews and updates
- Dependency updates for security patches
- Backend API security coordination
- Documentation updates for security changes

## Compliance & Standards

### Security Standards
- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- Secure coding practices
- Data protection regulations compliance
- Industry-specific security requirements

### Regular Security Activities

## Development Security Guidelines

### Secure Coding Practices
- Always validate and sanitize inputs
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Implement proper error handling without information leakage
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Use secure communication protocols

### Code Review Requirements
- All code must pass security review
- Security checklist must be completed
- Automated security testing must pass
- Manual penetration testing for major changes

### Deployment Security
- Secrets must never be committed to code
- Use Wrangler secrets management
- Verify security configurations before deployment
- Monitor deployment for security issues
