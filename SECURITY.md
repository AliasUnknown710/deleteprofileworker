1. **Detailed Description**: Clear explanation of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
3. **Impact Assessment**: Potential impact and severity
4. **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots demonstrating the issue
5. **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for remediation

### Disclosure Policy

We follow a **responsible disclosure** policy:

1. **Private Resolution**: We work with you privately to resolve the issue
2. **Fix Development**: We develop and test a fix
3. **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed, we may publish details
4. **Credit**: We provide credit to researchers (if desired)

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Bearer Token Authentication**: All DELETE requests require valid Bearer tokens
- **Token Validation**: Tokens are passed to backend for validation
- **No Token Storage**: Worker does not store or cache authentication tokens

### Input Validation

- **Parameter Validation**: All input parameters are validated
- **URL Encoding**: User IDs are properly URL-encoded
- **Method Restriction**: Only DELETE method is accepted

### Error Handling

- **Information Disclosure Prevention**: Error messages are sanitized
- **No Sensitive Data Logging**: Tokens and sensitive data are not logged
- **Graceful Degradation**: Proper error responses for all failure modes

### Environment Security

- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration stored as Cloudflare secrets
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: No credentials or URLs in source code
- **Secure Transport**: HTTPS enforced for all communications

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Code Review**
   - All changes require security review
   - Focus on authentication and input validation
   - Check for information disclosure

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Monitor for security advisories
   - Use `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Use Cloudflare secrets for sensitive data
   - Never commit secrets to version control
   - Rotate secrets regularly

### For Operators

1. **Backend Security**
   - Implement proper token validation
   - Use HTTPS for all endpoints
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Log security events

2. **Monitoring**
   - Monitor for unusual request patterns
   - Set up alerts for error spikes
   - Track authentication failures

3. **Access Control**
   - Limit Cloudflare account access
   - Use least privilege principle
   - Regular access reviews

## Threat Model

### Assets
- User profile data (indirectly accessed)
- Authentication tokens (in transit)
- Backend API endpoints
- Cloudflare Worker configuration

### Threats

#### 1. Unauthorized Profile Deletion
- **Threat**: Attacker deletes profiles without authorization
- **Mitigation**: Bearer token authentication required
- **Backend Validation**: Backend must validate tokens

#### 2. Information Disclosure
- **Threat**: Sensitive information leaked in error messages
- **Mitigation**: Sanitized error responses
- **Logging Controls**: No sensitive data in logs

#### 3. Denial of Service
- **Threat**: Excessive requests overwhelming the service
- **Mitigation**: Cloudflare's built-in DDoS protection
- **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting

#### 4. Man-in-the-Middle Attacks
- **Threat**: Interception of authentication tokens
- **Mitigation**: HTTPS enforcement
- **Token Security**: Short-lived tokens recommended

#### 5. Backend Compromise
- **Threat**: Backend API vulnerability exploitation
- **Mitigation**: Defense in depth, input validation
- **Monitoring**: Backend security monitoring

## Security Controls

### Technical Controls

1. **HTTPS Enforcement**
   ```javascript
   // All requests must use HTTPS in production
   if (request.url.startsWith('http://') && env.ENVIRONMENT === 'production') {
       return Response.redirect(request.url.replace('http://', 'https://'), 301);
   }
   ```

2. **Input Validation**
   ```javascript
   // Validate user_id parameter
   if (!user_id || typeof user_id !== 'string' || user_id.trim().length === 0) {
       return new Response("Invalid user_id", { status: 400 });
   }
   ```

3. **Header Validation**
   ```javascript
   // Validate Authorization header format
   if (!authToken || !authToken.startsWith('Bearer ')) {
       return new Response("Invalid authorization format", { status: 401 });
   }
   ```

### Administrative Controls

1. **Access Management**
   - Cloudflare account access restricted
   - Regular access reviews
   - Multi-factor authentication required

2. **Change Management**
   - All changes go through pull request review
   - Security review for sensitive changes
   - Deployment approval process

3. **Incident Response**
   - Security incident response plan
   - Contact information maintained
   - Regular plan testing

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Protection

1. **GDPR Compliance**
   - Right to erasure (deletion) supported
   - Audit logging of deletion requests
   - Data processor agreements with Cloudflare

2. **Data Minimization**
   - Only necessary data processed
   - No data stored in Worker
   - Minimal logging

### Industry Standards

1. **OWASP Top 10**
   - Protection against common web vulnerabilities
   - Regular security assessments
   - Secure coding practices

2. **ISO 27001 Alignment**
   - Information security management
   - Risk assessment procedures
   - Security controls implementation

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing

1. **Dependency Scanning**
   ```bash
   # Regular vulnerability scanning
   npm audit
   npm audit fix
   ```

2. **Static Analysis**
   ```bash
   # Code quality and security linting
   npm run lint
   eslint --security *.js
   ```

### Manual Testing

1. **Authentication Testing**
   - Test with invalid tokens
   - Test with missing tokens
   - Test with malformed tokens

2. **Input Validation Testing**
   - Test with missing parameters
   - Test with malformed parameters
   - Test with injection attempts

3. **Error Handling Testing**
   - Test error message content
   - Test information disclosure
   - Test error logging

### Penetration Testing

- Annual penetration testing recommended
- Focus on authentication and authorization
- Test both Worker and backend integration

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Types

1. **Unauthorized Access**
   - Invalid authentication attempts
   - Successful unauthorized deletions
   - Backend compromise

2. **Service Disruption**
   - DDoS attacks
   - Service availability issues
   - Performance degradation

3. **Data Incidents**
   - Unintended data exposure
   - Audit log tampering
   - Configuration exposure

### Response Procedures

1. **Detection**
   - Monitor error rates and patterns
   - Alert on authentication failures
   - Backend security monitoring

2. **Containment**
