# Contributing to Delete Profile Worker

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Delete Profile Worker! This document provides guidelines for contributing to this Cloudflare Worker project.

## Project Overview

This worker is part of a larger authentication and user management system built on Cloudflare Workers. It handles secure user profile deletion with proper authentication and backend integration.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- Wrangler CLI
- Access to Cloudflare Workers
- Backend API for user management

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Copy configuration: `cp wrangler.toml.example wrangler.toml`
4. Configure your environment variables
5. Set up secrets: `wrangler secret put BACKEND_URL`

## Code Style and Standards

### General Guidelines

- Follow ES6+ JavaScript standards
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Write secure, production-ready code
- Include proper input validation and sanitization

### Security Requirements

- Always validate and sanitize inputs
- Use proper authentication mechanisms
- Never expose sensitive information in error messages
- Implement proper CORS configuration
- Follow the principle of least privilege

### Code Structure

- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add comprehensive comments for complex logic
- Maintain consistent error response formats

## Testing

### Manual Testing

- Use the provided `test.html` file for interactive testing
- Test all error conditions and edge cases
- Verify authentication and authorization flows
- Test integration with backend services

### Test Cases to Cover

- Valid profile deletion requests
- Invalid authentication tokens
- Missing required parameters
- Backend service failures
- Rate limiting scenarios
- CORS preflight requests

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch from main
2. Make your changes following the code style guidelines
3. Test your changes thoroughly using the test interface
4. Update documentation if necessary
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description

### Commit Message Format

```
type(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation of changes if needed
```

Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization

- All profile deletion requests must be authenticated
- Verify user permissions before processing deletions
- Implement proper session management
- Use secure token validation

### Data Protection

- Never log sensitive user information
- Sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper error handling without information leakage

### Backend Integration

- Use secure communication protocols
- Validate all backend responses
- Implement proper timeout handling
- Handle backend service failures gracefully

## Documentation

- Update README.md for any new features
- Document configuration changes in setup guides
- Update API documentation for endpoint changes
- Include examples for new functionality
